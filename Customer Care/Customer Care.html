    <p >
        It is our core value to take care of our customers by all means. We love to listen you. Our AI (Artificial Intelligence) assisted chatbot, Jasmine, is available 24/7 to answer basic user queries in a human-friendly way. We are continuously making it better to handle maximum customer queries. In case Jasmine is unable to reply your queries, it will let you transfer to Live Chat with our Customer Care Team.
        The timings of Customer Care Team are listed in the Contact Us page. <br>

        We don't want that any of our site visitor feel bad experience with us just because of poor accessibility. 
        That's why we have tried our best to make our site accessible by diversity of people by following international best practices. 
        We have implemented the guidelines of W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) V2.1 level-AAA in 
        the design & development of this site. To know more about our accessibility best practices please visit Accessibility.
